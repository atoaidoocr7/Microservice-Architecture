# Microservice-Architecture


### Should you pivot to a Microservice Architecture ? 

There are many advantages  as well as disadvantages when it comes to working with a microservice architecture. Are you a startup, mid-size or even large size corporation looking to run a microservice architecture? Before deciding to pivot to a microservice architecture, there are some notable things: 

1. **Scalabilty** - Scalability in short terms refers to a measure of how easy it is to grow or shrink a piece of software based on the demand. There are times when an application might need to scale up and times when it might need to scale down. It is important to be ready to scale up and down at very unprecedented times. Your system and team must be ready to handle this.

2. **Agility** -  In short agile software development is  an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches.

3. **Distributed** - Microservices are distributed in nature in the sense that things like data stores and runtime and run on different computers. This leads to idealogies like eventual consistency. If your system cannot gracefully handle eventual consistency, it is most likely not a good idea to run a microservice architecture
